    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to the Lost and Found portal of <strong>Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri Campus</strong>. This website is designed to help students, faculty, and staff report and search for lost or found items on campus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you've misplaced something important or found an item that belongs to someone else, this platform helps connect people and return items to their rightful owners.
    </p>

    <p>
      👉 <strong>Lost something?</strong> Browse the listed items or report your lost item with details and contact info.<br>
      👉 <strong>Found something?</strong> Post it here with a description and where you found it, so the owner can reach you.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website was created as a student project to solve a real-world problem and make campus life more convenient and secure.
